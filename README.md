# Photography Shop Website

This is a photography shop website built using **React**. It provides functionalities for users to book appointments, process payments, and view their booking history in a personalized dashboard. All booking data is stored in the browser's **localStorage** to avoid the need for a backend database.

## Features

- **Booking Page**: Allows users to select an appointment date and provide their email for booking.
- **Payment Page**: Simulates a payment process and sends a confirmation email to the user using **EmailJS**.
- **Dashboard**: Displays a user's past bookings with their status (Upcoming or Completed).
- **Responsive Design**: The website is designed to be responsive for both desktop and mobile users.
- **LocalStorage**: Booking details (including the date, email, and status) are stored in the browser's localStorage, so users can see their past bookings even after refreshing the page or reopening the browser.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: For building the user interface.
- **React Router DOM**: For navigation between pages.
- **EmailJS**: For sending email confirmations to users.
- **Bootstrap**: For styling the components (using `react-bootstrap` for easy layout management).
- **HTML5 & CSS3**: For structuring and styling the content.
- **LocalStorage**: To store and retrieve user booking data without using a database.
